1. Introduction
Thank you for downloading the "Water-Woes" water pipe simulation program.
2. Starting
To run the program, use your IDE of choice and create a new WWWindow.
3. Operation
3.1 The UI
On the left two-thirds of the screen sits an 8x8 grid for you to craft your network on.
On the right third of the screen sits the menu of buttons depicting all pipes and rotations available to you.
Simply click a pipe to select it, and click the grid to place the currently selected pipe.
Sources, the round blue pipes, are the source of water. Any pipes connected to these sources will be filled with water.
